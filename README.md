In this project let's build a **GitHub Profile Visualizer** by applying the concepts we have learned till now. This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned till React Course and apply them in a concrete project.

You will demonstrate your skills by creating an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a component, displaying that data, **routing** and **context** concepts, and adding responsiveness to the website.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. You can request for the feedback after your project submission in the discussions.

### Stretch Goals

If you complete the main features of the project you can try out the below features as well.

**Note:** Just a reminder the additional functionality is just extra practice using the tools we have learned. These are not required. If you do not reach the stretch goals, don't worry.

<details>
<summary>Additional Functionality to be added</summary>

- Analysis Route:
  - Users should be able to see the commit history of the last six months in a graph.

</details>

### Project Submission Instructions

- For Mini Projects, you can submit the test cases at your own pace. But we suggest you to submit the code to know the percentage of completion through test cases and that score will be considered for your interviews.

- Also it's important to publish your code frequently using `Step - 4` in the Instructions tab.

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts you’ve been learning? Take a look at the Cheat Sheets
